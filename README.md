## Data files:
- batch20: GPT responses on the original run ("Experiment 1: Run 1") for all words, rated for each SCOPE variable.
- batch20b: GPT responses on the replication of the original run ("Experiment 1: Run 2") for all words, rated for each SCOPE variable.
- batchRand: GPT responses using a newly randomized word order ("Experiment 2: Rnd") for all words, rated for each SCOPE variable.
- batchSort: GPT responses using a sorted word order ("Experiment 2: Srt") for all words, rated for each SCOPE variable.
- sds: mean and standard deviation for words in each Glasgow variable, sorted into "high SD" and "low SD" groups. Within each variable, words are paired across groups controlling for mean.
- data_compiled.csv: GPT responses compiled into a single file for analyses (produced by "compile_data.R").
- glasgow-main.csv: mean and standard deviation statistics, per word, for the Glasgow data.
- words390.csv: SCOPE data on all 16 variables for all 390 words.

## R files:
- compile_data.R: compiles GPT responses into a single .csv file.
- correlation_analysis.Rmd: all analyses reported in the manuscript.
